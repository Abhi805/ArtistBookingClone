            {id} Anmol Garg, or "Corporate Babaji," as he likes to call himself, is a Bengaluru stand-up comedian and has created his own space in the genre of corporate and startup humor. The professional qualifications of Garg are in software engineering and entrepreneurship, and this real-life experience informs all his comedic narratives, which run deep within the corporate professionals who are relatable to them.

He was working as a software engineer for IBM before taking the plunge into comedy. After that, he started Sales5X, which is a training and consulting firm for sales. His experiences of having traveled through a variety of jobs in the corporate world provided him with a treasure trove of material, which he now turns into fun and relatable entertainment. His acts generally focus on subjects like office politics, start-up culture, and the brass tacks of corporate life-the realities of homelessness for many working adults.

Garg's unique style of comedic play has attracted numerous admirers on platforms such as LinkedIn and Instagram, where he shares excerpts of his performances and interacts with the audience. Given his ability to speak about workplace issues with humor and authenticity, Garg has become one of the most sought-after performers at corporate events and conferences. Indeed, he has been the performer in several prominent events like the ET Soonicorns Summit 2023, where he enlightened and entertained the audience regarding the insights into corporate dynamics.

Garg is also active on YouTube, where he's established a significant digital property for uploading his stand-up routines that cover every aspect of life in the world today. His brand of wit is sharp but pretty observational, offering refreshing perspectives on living the daily grind of corporate existence.

Through his art, Anmol Garg is continuing to build a bridge between comedy and corporate culture: laughter and seriousness for audiences. The difference he makes is the joyful entertainment he provides for audiences while stirring up thought, discussion, and debate regarding the realities of professional life. Anmol has become a truly unique stand-up comic voice.
